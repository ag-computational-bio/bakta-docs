# Auxillary scripts

Often, the usage of Bakta is a necessary upfront task followed by deeper analyses implemented in custom scripts. In [scripts](scripts) we'd like to collect & offer a pool of scripts addressing common tasks:

- `collect-annotation-stats.py`: Collect annotation stats for a cohort of genomes and print a condensed `TSV`.
- `extract-region.py`: Extract genome features within a given genomic range and export them as `GFF3`, `Embl`, `Genbank`, `FAA` and `FFN`

Of course, pull requests are welcome ;-)
