# Bakta Web

Annotating genomes can be resource-intensive; it requires significant network bandwidth to prepare the required database and can require substantial computational resources for each annotation.
To overcome these limitations and to democratize access to high-quality sequence annotations, we offer 
a dedicated website **Bakta Web** at <https://bakta.computational.bio>.

This web version of Bakta uses a highly scalable cloud backend and is free for everyone to use. It also provides options to visualize and interactively explore Bakta results, both from your own local executions and from executions in our cloud service.

**Please be responsible in using this service: There are no technical rate limitations implemented, we kindly ask all users to act responsibly and with due respect.**

This chapter contains a basic overview how to use the web version.

- [Overview](./overview.md) - A basic overview of the landing page
- [Submitting](./submitting.md) - Explanation of all submit options of the web service
- [Monitoring](./monitoring.md) - How to monitor running and succeeded jobs
- [Results](./results.md) - All available result visualizations of the web service
