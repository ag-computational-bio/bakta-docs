- **Annotation table**: A searchable table of all annotated features including cross-references to all available databases
- **Genomeviewer**: An integrated IGV viewer to explore your annotated sequences.
- **Circular plot**: An interactive circular plot of your annotated sequences.
- **Downloads**: All Bakta output files as download for further processing.

Additionally this page contains a share button, with this you can share your annotation results to others.
